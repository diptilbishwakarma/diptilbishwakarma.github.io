                Hello there!! <br>
                Welcome to my personal portfolio.
                I'm Diptil Bishwakarma.
                I'm from Nepal and I'm 19 years old right now.
                I'm currently studying at Weber State University.
                I'm a Computer Science major and I'm in my second semester right now.
                I've some experience in customer service as well as networks as I worked for a networking company before.
                I've taken 10 classes so far in these two semesters and I love programming.
                I always thought of becoming a software engineer but after exploring database, I've developed an interest in database administration.
                My future goal is to become either a software engineer or to be a database administrator.
                So far, I've become profecient with python, C, html, CSS, Oracle SQL Developer, SQLite, and MySQL.
                I'm currently learning C++ and would learn javascript soon.
                This portfolio is for anyone who wants to know about the projects that I'll be doing during the spring semester of 2025 at Weber State University.
